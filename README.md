# Summarizing-Norwegian_Texts_using_NLP

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a text summarization model for Norwegian texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This involves contextualizing and extracting precise information while addressing the linguistic richness unique to the Norwegian language.

The steps followed are :

---------

### 1- Data Collection
We started by collecting data from various themes within the Norwegian language to diversify the content and enrich our database. 

-----------

### 2- Data Cleaning
To prepare the data for analysis, we performed several cleaning steps:

- Elimination of HTML tags
- Removal of special characters
- Removal of redundant whitespaces
- Elimination of stop words
- Conversion to lowercase
--------------------

### 3- Data Preparation
Next, we prepared the data for NLP processing:

- Tokenization: Splitting text into individual tokens
- Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form
----------------------------

### 4- Data Exploration
We explored the cleaned data to gain insights:

- Analyzing the length of cleaned texts
- Measuring lexical diversity
- Identifying the distribution of the most frequent words
- Creating word maps

------------------

### 5- Topic Modeling
We employed topic modeling techniques to identify and understand the underlying themes in the Norwegian texts. This helped in categorizing and summarizing the content effectively.

-------------------

### 6- Text Summarization Models
We applied advanced NLP models for text summarization:

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
DistilBERT (a smaller version of BERT)

---------------------
## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of NLP models to summarize Norwegian texts, highlighting the linguistic richness and contextual nuances of the language. The combination of data collection, cleaning, preparation, exploration, topic modeling, and the use of state-of-the-art summarization models ensures high-quality and informative summaries.
